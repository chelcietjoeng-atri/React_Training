// Summary:
// What: A simple reusable UI header to control which week the user is viewing in the app.
// Why: Keeps the user aware of what date range theyâ€™re interacting with, and allows them to navigate weeks in the planner or chart views.
// Why date-fns: To easily compute start/end of weeks and format dates without manual math.
// Why lift currentWeekStart to the parent: This allows other components (like the meal list or charts) to stay in sync with the selected week.
